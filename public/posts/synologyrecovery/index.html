<p>The main use of the old ReadyNAS was an a rsync target for backing up my main Synology rack station.  I have about 2.5TB of rsync’d files.  I wanted to reuse the existing rsync files to avoid the several months necessary to build a new  backup.</p>
<p>I thought I could just repoint the existing Hyper Backup jobs on the Synology rack station.  This did not work as I couldn’t reset the name of the share where the files were to be backed up to.  I also tried building new jobs using the targets of the copied files but this would error out because HyperBackup would report that files already existed in the target directories.</p>
<p>To work around these issues what I was able to do was create new rsync single copy backup jobs in HyperBackup with the same source as the existing jobs but pointing to new backup locations.  I then started the backup jobs.  I then canceled them shortly after they started. Once fully canceled I copied the old rsync files into the new backup locations.  I set the file ownership of these files to the same account used to run the rsync.  Once I did this I could restart the HyperBackup jobs and they detected the existence of the files.  This saved months of rerunning HyperBackup to fully rebuild the backup images.</p>
