        Recover Synology rsync backup jobs

      <p>I recently upgraded a very old Netgear ReadyNAS device to a new Synology DS-420+ at a remote location.</p>
<p>The main use of the old ReadyNAS was an a rsync target for backing up my main Synology rack station.  I have about 2.5TB of rsync’d files.  I wanted to reuse the existing rsync files to avoid the several months necessary to build a new  backup.</p>
<p>I thought I could just repoint the existing Hyper Backup jobs on the Synology rack station.  This did not work as I couldn’t reset the name of the share where the files were to be backed up to.  I also tried building new jobs using the targets of the copied files but this would error out because HyperBackup would report that files already existed in the target directories.</p>

        SWD Breakout and Breadboard for Nano 33 BLE Sense
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The Arduino Nano 33 BLE (Sense) and the Nano 33 IoT expose SWD pads on the bottom of the board.  These pads expose the SWD interface that enable debugging when used with an SWD compatible debugger such as the Segger <a href="https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/">J-Link Mini EDU</a>.</p>
<p>The pads on the bottom of the Nanos are very small (and as we’ll see later quite fragile).  Normally you would use some form of test fixture and pogo pins to connect to the pads.  I don’t have that.  Some approaches show soldering dupont wires to the pads and then connecting to the J-Link via and adapter.</p>

        Resolution on Bind9 on NFS

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>After a good bit of investigation and thinking… the problem with bind9 has nothing to do with bind9. The problem was a mismatch between UIDs between the Synology NAS server and the bind account on the pi. As I was using sec=sys for authentication all the authentication is based on UIDs. On the pi bind has a UID of 109. There was no account on my Synology NAS with a UIDs of 109. Hence the access was denied by the NFS server.</p>

You can use one at a time, the order of how you make the various calls is important. Check it out on GitHub in <a href="https://github.com/tjpetz/SetWifiPoC">SetWiFiPoC</a>.</p>

      <p>I’m working on tracking down and resolving a humidity problem in our home. While I have some basic measurements of humidity through our Nest Thermostat and a Canary device I want broader coverage so I can measure localized problem areas. The relatively new Arduino 33 BLE Sense looks to be a great device to meet my needs.</p>
<p>I’m creating a simple network combining BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and WiFi. I’m planning to use an Arduino 33 BLE Sense to measure the environment. the Arduino 33 BLE Sense doesn’t have Wifi. I’m planning to use an Arduino 33 IoT to act as a “gateway”, polling the Sense for measurements and periodically publishing them to an MQTT broker. The MQTT broker will be Mosquitto running on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

      <p>I upgraded NetworkBrowser to Xcode 10.  The biggest change is in starting to internationalize the application.  With Xcode 10 there is a big focus on internationalization (this is a very good thing).  But with this focus comes some warnings for layout builder.  I found that I could resolve most of the issues after viewing this WWDC 2018 video <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/201/">Creating Apps for a Global Audience</a> and using the stacked layout view.</p>

        Configure Asus AC-68U Router VPN

      <p>The Asus AC-68U (like many routers) supports VPN functionality with the OpenVPN SSL based VPN software.  Out of the box the VPN is very simple to configure.  However, as delivered it uses quite a weak self signed certificate by Asus.  Additionally because of the way the default certs are configured it really only securely supports a single client.</p>
<p>I searched the web and the documentation but didn’t find a good tutorial on configuring the router with your own certificates.   With some trial and error I was able to work out how to configure the system with my own CA and Certs.  This tutorial describes the steps I took to configure the system.  In this tutorial I assume you have your own CA and some basic familiarity with CAs and Certs.</p>
