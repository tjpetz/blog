I have about 2.5TB of rsync‚Äôd files. I wanted to reuse the existing rsync files to avoid the several months necessary to build a new backup.\nI thought I could just repoint the existing Hyper Backup jobs on the Synology rack station. This did not work as I couldn‚Äôt reset the name of the share where the files were to be backed up to. I also tried building new jobs using the targets of the copied files but this would error out because HyperBackup would report that files already existed in the target directories.\nTo work around these issues what I was able to do was create new rsync single copy backup jobs in HyperBackup with the same source as the existing jobs but pointing to new backup locations. I then started the backup jobs. I then canceled them shortly after they started. Once fully canceled I copied the old rsync files into the new backup locations. I set the file ownership of these files to the same account used to run the rsync. Once I did this I could restart the HyperBackup jobs and they detected the existence of the files. This saved months of rerunning HyperBackup to fully rebuild the backup images.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/nanobreakout/","title":"SWD Breakout and Breadboard for Nano 33 BLE Sense","section":"Posts","content":"The Arduino Nano 33 BLE (Sense) and the Nano 33 IoT expose SWD pads on the bottom of the board. These pads expose the SWD interface that enable debugging when used with an SWD compatible debugger such as the Segger J-Link Mini EDU.\nThe pads on the bottom of the Nanos are very small (and as we‚Äôll see later quite fragile). Normally you would use some form of test fixture and pogo pins to connect to the pads. I don‚Äôt have that. Some approaches show soldering dupont wires to the pads and then connecting to the J-Link via and adapter.\nI‚Äôve used a solderless breadboard with my Nano 33 BLE Sense and an Adafruit SWD Breakout Board to build a debugging and breadboard setup.\nThe SWD debugging interface needs GND, the 3.3v Reference, SWCLK, SWDIO, and RESETN. All these signals are available on the bottom of the Nano board. To minimize the number of wires to solder I decided to pull SWCLK, SWDIO, and RESETN (turned out to be a bad idea) from the pads.\nStep 1 is to solder the wires to the Nano. Pin 2 (Blue) = SWDIO Pin 3 (Green) = SWCLK Pin 6 (White) = RESETN\nApplying some hot glue (should) help keep the wires in place.\nNow we start assembling the solderless breadboard. Here we‚Äôll wire the 3.3 volt reference to Pin 2, pickup ground from Pin 14. We‚Äôll run the wires down the central channel to maintain clearance under the Nano.\nNow we start to layout the board with our wires.\nWe‚Äôll run the wires so they are neat and go under each board.\nWhile assembling, the White Wire, Pin 6 (RESETN) ripped off the board üòû A most unhappy moment. I was being very careful while stripping the wire but it must have slipped. Reviewing the board and the photos the hot glue was probably not making sufficient contact with the board over the white wire.\nWhile reviewing videos on repairing PCBs I decided to go double check which wire was ripped off. At that point I realized that it was the RESETN and that signal is also available on Pin 13 of the Nano header. Rather than attempt to repair the board (for which i don‚Äôt really have the right tools) I decided to simply take the RESETN signal from the header.\nThe Nano is then placed on the board the SWCLK and SWDIO are carefully routed to their pins on the breakout board.\nThe breakout board may now be placed on the breadboard.\nFinally we can now connect the Segger J-Link Mini EDU.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/bind9onnfs/","title":"Resolution on Bind9 on NFS","section":"Posts","content":"After a good bit of investigation and thinking‚Ä¶ the problem with bind9 has nothing to do with bind9. The problem was a mismatch between UIDs between the Synology NAS server and the bind account on the pi. As I was using sec=sys for authentication all the authentication is based on UIDs. On the pi bind has a UID of 109. There was no account on my Synology NAS with a UIDs of 109. Hence the access was denied by the NFS server.\nTo continue using NFS for the root filesystem I will need to either run in an insecure configuration: you can map every single vid on the client to the admin account on the Synology and then grant full access to the files on the Synology. However that means every account on the pi would end up having full admin access over everything. Certainly not a very good idea. Or alternately I‚Äôd need to manage ALL accounts centrally on the Synology for all the pi‚Äôs. This seems like a bit of an overkill in complexity.\nTo avoid the complexity I‚Äôm going to use iSCSI for the root filesystem for each pi. I‚Äôll probably use NFS for common shares such as home directories and where I want to share docker images.\nThis is a good concise guide for configuring iSCSI on a pi for booting: https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28797. Note, it does assume some familiarity with iSCSI. Assuming you have that familiarity it‚Äôs a really good short guide.\nI decided against using the script to switch between SD and iSCSI booting included in the article. For the few times I may need to revert to SD booting I‚Äôll user a different SD or simply copy the cmdline.txt and config.txt files from their original configuration.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/posts/troublewithbind9onnfs/","title":"Trouble with Bind9 on a Pi with NFS root","section":"Posts","content":"I got a new Raspberry Pi 4 as I‚Äôm looking to consolidate some of my old Pi‚Äôs and clean up my servers. To avoid issues with wearing out the SD cards I mount the root file system off an NFS NAS storage server.\nUnfortunately I‚Äôve hit a problem with installing Bind9 using the defaults when mounting root via NFS. When starting Bind9 I get the error\nnamed[5466]: working directory ‚Äò/var/cache/bind‚Äô is not writable\nHowever, the /var/cache/bind directory is fully writable by the bind account.\nRunning a few test I verified that the exact same configuration works when the root filesystem is on the SD card. It seems this issue is related to the chroot that the bind9 runs in by default. If I edit /etc/defaults/bind9 and remove ‚Äú-u bind‚Äù from OPTIONS then bind starts.

Out of the box the VPN is very simple to configure. However, as delivered it uses quite a weak self signed certificate by Asus. Additionally because of the way the default certs are configured it really only securely supports a single client.\nI searched the web and the documentation but didn‚Äôt find a good tutorial on configuring the router with your own certificates. With some trial and error I was able to work out how to configure the system with my own CA and Certs. This tutorial describes the steps I took to configure the system. In this tutorial I assume you have your own CA and some basic familiarity with CAs and Certs.\nAs I have no requirements for externally trusted certificates I have setup my own CA on a Raspberry PI using OpenSSL on my network. I followed this tutorial to configure the CA. It‚Äôs also a very good tutorial for getting up to speed with OpenVPN from scratch.\nWith the version of OpenVPN on the Asus I‚Äôve noted a few particular settings that are not necessarily the same as other OpenVPN versions. In particular the server side certificates must be market with the server attribute and the client certs must be marked with the client attribute. (Note, the Asus CA seems to only generate client certs with the name ‚Äúclient‚Äù which means you can have only 1 unique client and cannot use the different client settings in the admin console.) This was the part that required trial and error because it didn‚Äôt become clear that these restrictions were in place until after my original certs were installed.\nConfigure your CA # Add sections to your CA configuration file to enable the creation of Server and Client certs. In this case we just need sections and set the nsCertType parameter. Adding each section separately allows us to create server only and client only certs required by Asus.\n[ server_cert ] # Use this section to sign a cert that is authorized only for SSL server use. basicConstraints=CA:FALSE nsCertType = server nsComment = \u0026#34;OpenSSL generated certificate - server\u0026#34; subjectKeyIdentifier = hash authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer [ client_cert ] # Use this section to sign a cert that is authorized only for SSL client use. basicConstraints=CA:FALSE nsCertType = client nsComment = \u0026#34;OpenSSL generated certificate - client\u0026#34; subjectKeyIdentifier = hash authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer Create the server certs # Create a certificate request.
