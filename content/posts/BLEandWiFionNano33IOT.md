title = 'BLE and WiFi on Nano 33 IoT'
+++

Iâ€™ve put together a simple demo project of using both the BLE and WiFi radios on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Note, as there is only 1 radio you cannot use BLE and WiFi simultaneously. You can use one at a time, the order of how you make the various calls is important. Check it out on GitHub in [SetWiFiPoC](https://github.com/tjpetz/SetWifiPoC).
