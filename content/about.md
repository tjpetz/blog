I have been developing software for a very long time.  I learned FORTRAN on punch cards and  Z-80 assembler on a TRS-80 Model 1.  I cut my teeth professionally on PRIME systems, moving to VAXes and on to Unix workstations.  I’ve worked on Cray II’s and 8096 micro controllers.  I’m a computer engineer by education and I’ve spent most of my professional career more on the software than hardware side.

I love designing and then implementing software systems.  I am passionate about good code.  I strive for simplicity and help others understand the beauty and value of simplicity.

On this site I share some of my insights and current personal projects.

Enjoy!

Tom
